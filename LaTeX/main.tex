% (uncomment the ones you want to load)



% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % The IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  \graphicspath{{png/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage{acronym}
% acronym.sty was written by Tobias Oetiker. This package provides tools for
% managing documents with large numbers of acronyms. (You don't *have* to
% use this package - unless you have a lot of acronyms, you may feel that
% such package management of them is bit of an overkill.)
% Do note that the acronym environment (which lists acronyms) will have a
% problem when used under IEEEtran.cls because acronym.sty relies on the
% description list environment - which IEEEtran.cls has customized for
% producing IEEE style lists. A workaround is to declared the longest
% label width via the IEEEtran.cls \IEEEiedlistdecl global control:
%
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\IEEEsetlabelwidth{SONET}}
% \begin{acronym}
%
% \end{acronym}
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\relax}% remember to reset \IEEEiedlistdecl
%
% instead of using the acronym environment's optional argument.
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/acronym


%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/mdwtools


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/eqparbox




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.


% NOTE: PDF thumbnail features are not required in IEEE papers
%       and their use requires extra complexity and work.
%\ifCLASSINFOpdf
%  \usepackage[pdftex]{thumbpdf}
%\else
%  \usepackage[dvips]{thumbpdf}
%\fi
% thumbpdf.sty and its companion Perl utility were written by Heiko Oberdiek.
% It allows the user a way to produce PDF documents that contain fancy
% thumbnail images of each of the pages (which tools like acrobat reader can
% utilize). This is possible even when using dvi->ps->pdf workflow if the
% correct thumbpdf driver options are used. thumbpdf.sty incorporates the
% file containing the PDF thumbnail information (filename.tpm is used with
% dvips, filename.tpt is used with pdftex, where filename is the base name of
% your tex document) into the final ps or pdf output document. An external
% utility, the thumbpdf *Perl script* is needed to make these .tpm or .tpt
% thumbnail files from a .ps or .pdf version of the document (which obviously
% does not yet contain pdf thumbnails). Thus, one does a:
% 
% thumbpdf filename.pdf 
%
% to make a filename.tpt, and:
%
% thumbpdf --mode dvips filename.ps
%
% to make a filename.tpm which will then be loaded into the document by
% thumbpdf.sty the NEXT time the document is compiled (by pdflatex or
% latex->dvips->ps2pdf). Users must be careful to regenerate the .tpt and/or
% .tpm files if the main document changes and then to recompile the
% document to incorporate the revised thumbnails to ensure that thumbnails
% match the actual pages. It is easy to forget to do this!
% 
% Unix systems come with a Perl interpreter. However, MS Windows users
% will usually have to install a Perl interpreter so that the thumbpdf
% script can be run. The Ghostscript PS/PDF interpreter is also required.
% See the thumbpdf docs for details. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at.
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/thumbpdf


% NOTE: PDF hyperlink and bookmark features are not required in IEEE
%       papers and their use requires extra complexity and work.

%\usepackage[\MYhyperrefoptions,pdftex]{hyperref}
%\else
%\usepackage[\MYhyperrefoptions,breaklinks=true,dvips]{hyperref}
%\usepackage{breakurl}
%\fi
% One significant drawback of using hyperref under DVI output is that the
% LaTeX compiler cannot break URLs across lines or pages as can be done
% under pdfLaTeX's PDF output via the hyperref pdftex driver. This is
% probably the single most important capability distinction between the
% DVI and PDF output. Perhaps surprisingly, all the other PDF features
% (PDF bookmarks, thumbnails, etc.) can be preserved in
% .tex->.dvi->.ps->.pdf workflow if the respective packages/scripts are
% loaded/invoked with the correct driver options (dvips, etc.). 
% As most IEEE papers use URLs sparingly (mainly in the references), this
% may not be as big an issue as with other publications.
%
% That said, Vilar Camara Neto created his breakurl.sty package which
% permits hyperref to easily break URLs even in dvi mode.
% Note that breakurl, unlike most other packages, must be loaded
% AFTER hyperref. The latest version of breakurl and its documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/breakurl
% breakurl.sty is not for use under pdflatex pdf mode.
%
% The advanced features offer by hyperref.sty are not required for IEEE
% submission, so users should weigh these features against the added
% complexity of use.
% The package options above demonstrate how to enable PDF bookmarks
% (a type of table of contents viewable in Acrobat Reader) as well as
% PDF document information (title, subject, author and keywords) that is
% viewable in Acrobat reader's Document_Properties menu. PDF document
% information is also used extensively to automate the cataloging of PDF
% documents. The above set of options ensures that hyperlinks will not be
% colored in the text and thus will not be visible in the printed page,
% but will be active on "mouse over". USING COLORS OR OTHER HIGHLIGHTING
% OF HYPERLINKS CAN RESULT IN DOCUMENT REJECTION BY THE IEEE, especially if
% these appear on the "printed" page. IF IN DOUBT, ASK THE RELEVANT
% SUBMISSION EDITOR. You may need to add the option hypertexnames=false if
% you used duplicate equation numbers, etc., but this should not be needed
% in normal IEEE work.
% The latest version of hyperref and its documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/hyperref





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% use \thanks{} to gain access to the first footnote area
% a separate \thanks must be used for each paragraph as LaTeX2e's \thanks
% was not built to handle multiple paragraphs
%
%
%\IEEEcompsocitemizethanks is a special \thanks that produces the bulleted
% lists the Computer Society journals use for "first footnote" author
% affiliations. Use \IEEEcompsocthanksitem which works much like \item
% for each affiliation group. When not in compsoc mode,
% \IEEEcompsocitemizethanks becomes like \thanks and
% \IEEEcompsocthanksitem becomes a line break with idention. This
% facilitates dual compilation, although admittedly the differences in the
% desired content of \author between the different types of papers makes a
% one-size-fits-all approach a daunting prospect. For instance, compsoc 
% journal papers have the author affiliations above the "Manuscript
% received ..."  text while in non-compsoc journals this is reversed. Sigh.

\author{Ali Abbas% <-this % stops a space
% <-this % stops a space
}

% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks - 
% these prevent an unwanted space from occurring between the last author name
% and the end of the author line. i.e., if you had this:
% 
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

\begin{abstract}
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is of great interest in many fields of study due to its wide array of applications. Finding an exact solution to TSP is impractical, therefore we use a Parallel Genetic Algorithm (PGA) to find good solutions. We used an Island model of PGA, where each island is a thread that runs the basic GA on a sub-population, and the results are combined after all threads are finished. We used a Synchronous Dual Queue to handle the data exchange between threads that is needed for the migration between islands. The results of evaluating the implementation on 3 problems in TSPLIB showed that the implementation either found the optimal solution or at least found a good solution that was at most 3\% worse than the optimal solution. We also showed that the speedup of multi-threading over sequential implementation was linear up to the number of physical CPU cores.

\IEEEPARstart{T}{raveling} Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well known NP-hard problem about finding the shortest tour between cities, such that the traveling salesman visits each city once and returns back to the starting city. It has many real world applications such as optimizing the distribution of logistics between multiple locations, navigation, robotic path finding, and optimizing integrated circuit design. Because TSP is an NP-hard problem, finding an exact solution for a large number of cities is not practical, so instead I will use genetic algorithms (GA) to find approximate solutions that can be good enough for practical applications.\\
Implementing GA sequentially wastes a lot of computational resources, since most modern day computers have multi-core processors that can potentially yield better performances if the implementation can be executed concurrently on multiple threads. I will use an island model of parallel GA to implement the concurrent version. In this model best individuals migrate to other islands. This has been studied extensively in the literature, for example Wang et al., (2020) implemented a parallel GA based on island model on GPU CUDA to solve the TSP \cite{wang2020multipopulation}.\\
Migration presents a challenge to a naive parallel implementation, since each thread needs to receive and send some data to other threads, which will require some form of synchronisation. I will implement a synchronous dual queue, which is a concurrent data structure that can be used for the migration.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In section 2, the genetic algorithm is explained. Section 3 discusses the application of GA to TSP. In section 4 the island model of parallel GA, and Synchronous Dual Queue is presented. Section 5 presents the experimental results. Finally, section 6 concludes the paper.

\section{Genetic Algorithm}

Genetic algorithm (GA) is biologically inspired from the process of evolution in nature. In GA, a population consists of individuals where each individual is represented by its chromosome, which encodes all the relevant information about the individual in genes. Each gene can be viewed as encoding a single attribute of the individual, for example eye color, or height. Each chromosome can be represented by an array of integers, where each element of the array, represents a gene.\\
To simulate the process of evolution, we first start by creating a population of randomly generated individuals (chromosomes), where each individual is evaluated on how it is fitted to survive in the environment by applying a fitness function which assigns a fitness value to it. To simulate the process of mating, we use two genetic operators: crossover and mutation. To apply these operations first we need to select the individuals that will undergo the operation by applying a selection algorithm. There are different selection algorithms available, but here we will use a well known selection algorithm called tournament selection. In tournament selection, first we randomly select k (tournament size) individuals from the population and then with a probability p (tournament probability), the individual with highest fitness value is selected. To apply crossover, we select two individuals which are called parents, and exchange their genes according to a certain crossover operator, and produce two new individuals called children. To apply mutation, each gene of a child will be modified to a new value according to a certain mutation operator with probability determined by mutation rate. Children represent the next generation of the population, so we replace parents with children and repeat the whole process until a certain number of generations have passed. 
Figure \ref{fig:1} shows the flowchart of the basic genetic algorithm.

\section{Applying Genetic Algorithm to the Traveling Salesman Problem}

In order to find a solution to the TSP, we first need to represent a solution of the TSP as an individual (chromosome) in GA. We can assign a number to each city, and list the cities in the order that they are visited. Since the last visited city is also the first visited city, we only represent it once at the beginning of the list. For example the [5, 2, 3, 4, 1], represents this tour: 5 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 5. The fitness is calculated by summing all the distances along the tour. Figure \ref{fig:2} shows a sample population and tour.\\

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{png/02.png}
    \caption{Example of TSP encoded population and sample tour representation}
    \label{fig:2}
\end{figure}

For crossover, we use heuristic greedy crossover (HGreX) \cite{puljic2013comparison}. To perform HGreX on parent1 and parent2, we first select a random city c and add it to child 1. Let d1 be the distance between c and the next city cp1 in parent 1 (this means that cp1 is in the next location to c in parent 1). Likewise, let d2 be the distance between c and the next city cp2 in parent 2. Then we consider these four possibilities:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Both cp1 and cp2 has already been added to child 1:\\
    Select one unvisited city from each parent, and calculate the distance from these cities to the last added city in child 1. Add the closest city to the child 1.
    \item cp1 has already been added to child 1:\\
    Add cp2 to child 1.
    \item cp2 has already been added to child 1:\\
    Add cp1 to child 1.
    \item Neither cp1, nor cp2 has been added to child 1:\\
    Calculate the distance from cp1 and cp2 to the last added city in child 1. Add the closest city to the child 1.
\end{enumerate}

For mutation, we use a heuristic mutation (HM) that was proposed by Vahdati et al., (2009) for solving TSP. It works by first selecting a random city c in the parent, then we find the closest city cp to the selected city and reverse the order of cities between those c and cp such that cp becomes the next city after c, and the city before cp becomes the second next city and so on (in this approach when we reach the end of an array we loop back to the beginning) \cite{vahdati2009new}.\\
To allow for more diversity in later generations where most individuals have converged and become very similar, we also use Exchange Mutation (EM) \cite{larranaga1999genetic}, which simply selects two cities in the list and swaps them. For example if cities 8 and 1 are selected from [5, 6, 8, 2, 7, 1, 3, 4], then the resulting chromosome after mutation will be [5, 6, 1, 2, 7, 8, 3, 4].\\  
We always use HM in every generation, and after applying HM, we apply EM with probability determined by a variable mutation rate which is calculated in each generation as the maximum mutation rate * (generation / number of generations). This allows for more diversity in later generations where most individuals have converged and become very similar.

\section{Parallel Genetic Algorithm}

Genetic Algorithm can naturally be extended to run in parallel, since a population can easily be divided into sub-populations that can be distributed among different threads. One popular method of parallelizing GA is the island model approach, where each sub-population can be thought of living on an island and are evolving independently of other islands but every few generations, best individuals from an island will migrate to another island. The migration mechanism allows for the best solutions found to propagate through the whole population, while the isolation of islands helps in keeping the diversity of the solutions such that we are not trapped in local optima.\\
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{png/03.png}
    \caption{Island Model of Parallel GA}
    \label{fig:3}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:3}. Shows the island model of Parallel GA (PGA), where each thread is running the basic GA (shown in Figure \ref{fig:1}) with a sub-population that sends its two best individuals to the next thread every m generations, where m is the migration interval that determines how frequently the migration occurs. The migration occurs with a probability mr, where mr is the migration rate that determines the probability of a successful migration (there’s a chance that the migration fails and the best individuals are not sent to the next thread). The receiving thread replaces its worst two individuals with the received individual with probability mr, every m generations.


\subsection{Synchronous Dual Queue}

The migration of individuals between islands can be thought of as exchange of data between threads, which poses a serious challenge to the parallel implementation. For example thread A can be in its 5th generation when it needs the data from thread B which is in its 3rd generation. So thread A must wait for two generations until thread B can provide the data that it needs. A solution to this problem can be found using a variation of a synchronous data structure. One such data structure is Synchronous Dual Queue described in detail in \cite{herlihy2012art}.\\
Synchronous Dual Queue is a dual data structure that splits enqueue and dequeue methods into two steps: reservation and fulfillment. If a dequeuer tries to remove an item from an empty queue, instead of throwing an exception, it inserts a reservation object into the queue, then spins on the item in the reservation object until it’s non-null, which means an enqueuer fulfilled the reservation by providing an item. Similarly, if an enqueuer does not find any reservations in the queue, it adds a new node, but instead of immediately returning, it spins on the item in the node until it becomes null, which means it was taken by a dequeuer. In this way, enqueuers and dequeuers can meet and sync with each other while exchanging data \cite{herlihy2012art}.\\
Synchronous Dual Queue as described in \cite{herlihy2012art} is not suitable for implementing the migration, because first we have all the islands enqueue their data and wait for a dequeuer, but there are no dequeuers, since all threads are waiting in the enqueue stage. Therefore I modified the implementation to allow for the enqueue method to not spin waiting for a dequeuer, instead it returns immediately after adding a node or fulfilling a reservation. In this way, the enqueuer can run a head adding items and not worry about being in perfect sync with the dequeuer, because eventually the dequeuer will get all the items in order. So the only blocking method will be dequeue, because a thread still can’t advance if it does not receive the data it needs, so it must wait for an enqueuer to provide them.

\section{Experimental Results and Evaluation}

To evaluate the implementation, I used the symmetric traveling salesman problem (TSP) samples from TSPLIB, which is a library of TSP problem samples with given optimal solutions for a subset of the problems \cite{TSPLIB2013}. I selected berlin52.tsp (52 locations in Berlin (Groetschel)), pr76.tsp (76-city problem (Padberg/Rinaldi)), and rd100.tsp (100-city random TSP (Reinelt)), which represent different levels of difficulty as number of cities grow from 52 to 76, and 100. Each file contains the coordinates of the cities that we used to calculate the distance matrix, that returns the distance between any two cities. I also calculated the optimal tour length from the given optimal tours in TSPLIB, which for berlin52 is 7544.365902, for pr76 is 108159.438274, and for rd100 is 7910.396210.\\
I ran the experiments on a Windows 10 Laptop with Intel Core i7-4720HQ CPU @ 2.6 GHz with 4 physical cores and hyperthreading, 16 GB RAM, and Nvidia GeForce GTX 970M Graphic Card. Java 8 was used to code the implementation.\\
To evaluate the effect of the number of threads on execution times, I varied the number of threads (number of islands) with these values: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32. Each problem with a given number of threads was executed 10 times such that I can obtain 95\% confidence intervals on execution times to account for inevitable variation that occurs in concurrent programming, since we don’t know how the threads will be scheduled. The following parameters was shared between all problems:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Number of Runs: 10
    \item Tournament Size: 4
    \item Tournament Probability: 1
    \item Crossover Rate: 1
    \item Mutation Rate: 0.7
    \item Migration Interval: 50
    \item Migration Rate: 0.8
    \item Random Seed: 8512376
\end{itemize}

Random seed is used for the random number generator to guarantee that executing the program with the same parameters, always yields the same results. Number of generations was 500 for berlin52 and rd100, and was 200 for pr76. Population size was 100008 for pr76 and rd100, and was 10008 for berlin52.\\
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{png/04.png}
    \caption{Fitness vs Generation of thread 1 for rd100 problem with 16 threads}
    \label{fig:4}
\end{figure}
For berlin52, 96.6\% of all runs found the optimal solution. For pr76, only 5\% of all runs found the optimal solution, but even the worst solutions were only 3\% longer than the optimal, which means it’s adequate for most practical purposes. For rd100, only 8.3\% of all runs found the optimal solution, but even the worst solutions were only 2\% longer than the optimal, which means it’s adequate for most practical purposes. Figure \ref{fig:4} shows the fitness vs generations of thread 1 for rd100 problem with 16 threads. Results are averaged over 10 runs and 95\% confidence intervals are added as well. This graph is very typical of all such graphs, where the population rapidly converges to a very good solution, but takes a long time to find the optimal solution, since the good solution is a local optima that traps the GA and makes it harder to find the global optima. As we can see the average fitness becomes slightly worse, since we are using a variable mutation rate that introduces more variation as the number of generations increases.\\
Figure \ref{fig:5} Shows the optimal solution  for the rd100 problem, using 16 threads.

    \label{fig:5}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:6} Shows the execution time vs number of threads for the berlin52 problem. As we can see, up to the number of 4 physical CPU cores, the speedup is linear with the number of threads, ie. as the number of threads doubles, the execution time halves. Since we have hyperthreading in our CPU, we see a slight benefit from increasing the threads to 8, but beyond that, the execution time gets worse as the overhead of using more threads eliminates any benefits of having more threads. The same trend can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:7} and Figure \ref{fig:8} which show the execution time vs number of threads for the pr76 and the rd100 problems respectively.\\

\section{Conclusion}
The PGA with the island model was effective in solving berlin52, pr76, and rd100 problems of the TSPLIB. In all cases, either the optimal solution was found or the found solution was within the 3\% margin of error of the optimal solution. In regards to the relation between execution time and the number of threads, we observed a linear relationship when number of threads were smaller than or equal to the number of physical CPU cores, after that up to the number of threads supported by hyperthreading, which was 8 for my CPU, there was a slight improvement, but beyond that no improvement was observed. Also the implementation of Synchronous Dual Queue worked very well and was able to synchronize the threads without any issues.
